            <p>Freepik is a website where users can get paid and free media resources. The touch targets of the site are
                very accessible. The home page shows a filter icon at the top right corner of the header. If the user
                clicks it, he/she will see that the options for filtering search results are very user-friendly. There
                is enough space in between touch targets that allows the user to make a more specific search.</p>

            <img src="images/khanacademyhome.jpg" alt="khan academy home">
            <p>Khan Academy, an online learning website, has several elements on its landing page. Even if there are
                different elements like images and texts on the page, reading through it will not strain the user’s
                eyes. There is enough white space to allow the user's eyes to rest. And the elements were arranged in
                such a way that will catch the user’s attention. </p>

            <h3>Ecosia</h3>

            <img src="images/ecosia.jpg" alt="ecosia home">
            <p>Ecosia, a search engine that aims to plant trees, only has a few elements on its home page. The
                arrangement of the elements helps the user understand the aim and use of Ecosia. The user’s eyes are
                guided to the purpose of the website, which is to carry out web searches. The user can also see the
                number of plants Ecosia users have planted. </p>
